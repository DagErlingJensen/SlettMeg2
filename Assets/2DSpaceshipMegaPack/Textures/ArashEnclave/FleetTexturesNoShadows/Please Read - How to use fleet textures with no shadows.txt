By default the spaceships have shadows on the right side to give a 3D effect.

However you maybe want to have these shadows gone.

You can either remove the shadows in the PSD file (deactivate the subfolder called "shadows") 
or use the textures in this folder.

How to use them?

The "no shadow" textures are intended to overwrite the default textures. This way all 
the prefabs will be auto updated.

1. rename the "no shadow" textures by removing the "NoShadow" suffix. Now the "no shadow" texture 
is named exactly the same as the default texture.

2. Copy + paste the "no shadow" texture to the texture folder and overwrite the existing file.
You have to do the copy paste outside unity - means in windows/linux/max.
